# HTML data-* Attribute

## Defining data-* attribute
- The data-* attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application.
- The data-* attribute gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.

- The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).

- The data-* attribute consist of two parts:
  - The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"
  - The attribute value can be any string
Note: Custom attributes prefixed with "data-" will be completely ignored by the user agent.
